## Skill development
This skill utilizes the Cortex function service to execute custom code.
The function should be developed and tested before the skill is published to Cortex.
  
Wrapper scripts are provided to assist in developing and deploying your skill.
* `build-function.sh` packages the function in build/function.zip
* `deploy-function.sh` builds and deploys the function via Cortex's function apis
* `test-function.sh` invokes the deployed function via Cortex's function api
* `deploy-skill.sh` deploys the skill definition to Cortex's skill catalog
